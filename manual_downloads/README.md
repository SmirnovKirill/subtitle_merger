This directory contains other directories required to make a standalone application. I decided that it's 
better this way than writing scripts because download links can be changed any time and at the same time
it's not hard to download files manually. And you have to do this only once and these files will be used ever after.

# jdk
This directory is used for custom JRE creation. Download an archive with the desired JDK and unpack it into subdirectory
for your platform or platforms. If you want for example to download jdk 11 for windows you can go to 
https://jdk.java.net/archive/, find proper version 
(https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk11/9/GPL/openjdk-11.0.2_windows-x64_bin.zip), download it and unpack to
jdk/win_64.

# ffmpeg
This directory is optional.
